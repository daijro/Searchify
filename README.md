Heres a small program I wrote to help with Edgenuity... Its currently only in a beta so there still might be some bugs. It might be a little slow right now but I've tried everything I can to optimize it lol

Heres some screenshots of the [dark theme](https://i.imgur.com/HOywNMb.png), [black theme](https://i.imgur.com/56CP26a.png), and [light theme](https://i.imgur.com/0WvHxCt.png)


## It also only supports windows and I dont really have any plans to bring it to any other operating system. Sorry :/

### What it does:

- Search the first page of google for brainly and quizlet results

- Sort results by how similar the identified question is to the input question

- Parse the websites all at the same time (takes a lot of CPU)

- In quizlet sets, it finds which flashcard is the most similar to the input question

- In brainly, it gets all of the answers and how many Thanks each answer gets

- Toggle brainly and/or quizlet searching on and off

- Automatically switch to DuckDuckGo if Google isn't working

### Future plans:

- Add a built-in paraphraser

- Add button to input from clipboard

- Add hotkeys

- Add other sites (such as quizizz)

- Maybe add a mathway section ?

- Idk i need suggestions


### Known issues:

- Too many requests error

- Very slow on low end laptops

- The UI margins can be glitched

- Brainly answers with formatting aren't parsed correctly

- Complicated questions act weird


Let me know if it works!

I should also add that the UI is kinda buggy right now. To copy paste an answer, select the box the answer is in and do Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C.

I also forgot to include am uninstall option... You can just delete the installation folder under %appdata% to uninstall it. All the installer is is just a winrar self extraction archive
